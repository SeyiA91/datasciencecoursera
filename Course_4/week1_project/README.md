## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>

## Loading the data





When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:

* In your R console, please set your working directory to the directory where the file has been downloaded
on your machine (i.e. `setwd(insert file path here)`)

* The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First
calculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require
in memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough
memory (most modern computers should be fine).


## Making Plots

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage
varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to
reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed
using the base plotting system.

The four plots that have been constructed can be produced from the four files ending with
the file extension _.R_. To run a script, simply call the `source()` function in your console
with the name of the file passed as the argument. 

### Example:
`source(plot1.R)`

Remember that in order for the script to successfully run your present working directory must match
the location where the .zip file mentioned above was downloaded.
